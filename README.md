# Data Analytics Portfolio 

I am a data analyst focused on turning unclear business questions into structured analysis and actionable insights.  
This repository shows how I think and how I work with data, not only which tools I use.

---

## What I Do:

I use data to reduce uncertainty in decision-making.

My work typically includes:
- Translating vague business questions into clear analytical tasks
- Defining and validating metrics
- Exploring data quality issues
- Communicating insights in a clear and practical way

---

## Tools & Methods:

I use SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, Tableau and Metabase to explore data, validate assumptions, and support decisions.

My analytical workflow covers:
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Metric definition and reconciliation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Dashboard and report design  
- Basic statistics and trend analysis  

Tools are chosen based on the problem.

## Projects in This Repository

Each project answers a specific business question.

I focus on:
- Why the question matters  
- How the data is structured  
- Which assumptions are made  
- What trade-offs exist  
- How conclusions change when assumptions change

### Projects:

💹 #### DeFi Solvency & Risk Monitoring — GMX V2 Dashboard

Business Question:
Can liquidity pools remain solvent under extreme trader profitability?

Description:
Reconstructed the financial state of GMX V2 markets using on-chain data. Built stress, solvency, and skew indicators to evaluate protocol risk under adverse market conditions.

Focuses on translating blockchain data into financial risk metrics.

Key Skills:
SQL (DuneSQL), DeFi analytics, risk modeling, on-chain data analysis

Outcome:
Produced a monitoring system for identifying liquidity stress and asymmetric risk exposure.

📊 #### E-Commerce Inventory Analysis — ABC–XYZ Framework

Business Question:
Which products generate most revenue, and how stable is their demand over time?

Description:
Built an end-to-end analytical pipeline using transactional e-commerce data to segment products by:

Revenue importance (ABC / Pareto principle)

Demand stability (XYZ / coefficient of variation)

The project includes data cleaning, return handling, monthly aggregation, statistical validation, and interactive Tableau dashboards.

Key Skills:
SQL (DuckDB), data modeling, Pareto analysis, demand variability, Tableau dashboarding

Outcome:
Identified high-impact, low-risk SKUs (AX / AY) and high-risk revenue contributors (AZ / CX) to support inventory and procurement decisions.

📈 #### Market Anomaly Detection — Rolling Z-Score Framework

Business Question:
How can extreme price deviations be detected in volatile financial markets?

Description:
Developed a statistical monitoring system that transforms raw price data into normalized Z-scores using rolling windows. The model highlights price movements that fall outside historical probability ranges.

Includes sensitivity analysis across multiple time horizons and threshold testing.

Key Skills:
Python, time series analysis, statistical modeling, signal validation

Outcome:
Created an early-warning system for detecting abnormal market behavior and potential manipulation.
