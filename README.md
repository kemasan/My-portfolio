# Data Analytics Portfolio 

I am a data analyst focused on turning unclear business questions into structured analysis and actionable insights.  
This repository shows how I think and how I work with data, not only which tools I use.

## What I Do:

I use data to reduce uncertainty in decision-making.

My work typically includes:
- Translating vague business questions into clear analytical tasks
- Defining and validating metrics
- Exploring data quality issues
- Communicating insights in a clear and practical way

## Tools & Methods:

I use SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, Tableau and Metabase to explore data, validate assumptions, and support decisions.

My analytical workflow covers:
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Metric definition and reconciliation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Dashboard and report design  
- Basic statistics and trend analysis  

Tools are chosen based on the problem.

## Projects in This Repository

Each project answers a specific business question.

I focus on:
- Why the question matters  
- How the data is structured  
- Which assumptions are made  
- What trade-offs exist  
- How conclusions change when assumptions change
